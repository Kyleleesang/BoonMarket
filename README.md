# BoonMarket

The Boon Market is an NFT based exchange market where an NFT admin can buy an NFT, send it to the admin contract and then 
create refungible tokens for that NFT to sell. This is like selling individual shares of a trading card so that instead
of having to buy a whole NFT you can have some ownership in it. The NFT is sent to the admin contract which then with the refungible
tokens allows users to buy into the NFT. The NFT admin contract will later withdraw profits to the NFT buyer for his reward.

Front end is not yet implemented for this contract, development will continue and any open source contributions are very much welcome
